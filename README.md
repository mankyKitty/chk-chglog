chk-chglog
==========

This is a tiny app that I use on my internal projects in a git 'pre-commit' hook
to check that the `Changelog.fpm` file is correctly formatted. This helps avoid
trivial errors from only becoming apparent when everything has made its way to
the build system.

Also I wanted to tinker with [Rust](www.rustlang.org). 

Maybe someone else might find it useful, who knows!
